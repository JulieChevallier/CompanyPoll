# CompanyPoll

Company Poll is a voting application designed to facilitate decision-making for businesses through a simple and streamlined interface. Each vote is encrypted using the El-Gamal algorithm. The Shamir secret sharing technique is also used to secure data. To ensure the portability and scalability of the application, Docker is used to create isolated containers that can be deployed on different platforms. Finally, to confirm the confidentiality and integrity of the data, the Zero Knowledge Proof is implemented in the application. This technique allows verifying that a person has a certain knowledge without disclosing that knowledge itself.
